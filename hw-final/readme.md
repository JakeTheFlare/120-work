## Markdown for Week 12 - Final Week

[Link to my sketch.](https://jaketheflare.github.io/120-work/hw-11/)

Gotta say, the final week wasn't really what I expected, in more ways than one.  Just dove a little more into Object Oriented Programming (OOP), and got to learn a little bit about object interactions.  None of is was easy, it sure drove me crazy to.  

For my final project, I have decided to do something simple.  Just a sketch of some colorful balloons floating across the blue (cyan) sky, bumping into each other.  Nothing special (but tough though).  (Note: Last lesson when I said that I had a good idea of what I wanted to do, this wasn't necessarily it.  I had to change my game plan after meeting the requirements of this week's lesson.)

My strategy for this week was the same as always, nothing new.  After scheduling the right time to work on my project, I read over all of the lesson content, examples, and videos first thing before I got to work.  Then I began to layout my code.  And whenever I got stuck on something, I would read over the all of the lesson content over and over again, or take a brake and then go back to it later.

I had some trouble trying to get my balloons to try and bounce off of each other and the walls, so I had to post it on the class site.  Bad news is though, I had to wait a while.  Yet no one would reply back.  I didn't help out with other people's issues either.  They were going through the same issues as I was, and I didn't know how to help them (also, I didn't feel like helping because no one else would help me).

Overall, I feel a little disappointed with myself in the final week.  Didn't achieve the expectations I was hoping for, no one would come to my aid when I needed help, and I feel that I have created a very poor project. :(
