## Markdown for Week 11

[Link to my sketch.](https://jaketheflare.github.io/120-work/hw-11/)

For this week, I dove into Object Oriented Programming (OOP).  I learned all sorts of stuff like; classes, constructor methods, and the <i>this</i> syntax.  OOP really helped me get a better understanding about how objects work in coding, and it seemed pretty cool and efficient giving objects all of these functions and attributes.

For my project, after watching Micheal Musick's marching dudes example, I got inspired into creating something similar to it, but it serves as a depiction of what I witnessed when playing one of my Super Mario games years ago.

My game plan for this homework assignment was the same as always.  I read over all of the lesson content, examples, and videos first thing before I got to work.  Then I began to layout my code.  And whenever I got stuck on something, I read over the all content a few more times to see if I missed anything.  Or I would set the project aside for some time, and then go back and carefully examine the problem at hand.

The only issue I had to work with for this week was helping a fellow student named, <i>StuffnThingz</i> understand what "delta" meant in a code.  Technically, he already got an answer from someone else, but I helped support that answer.

After doing this assignment, I think I have an idea of what I want to do for my final project at the end of the semester.  I am looking forward to getting to work on it and using what I learned about OOP throughout the process.

As a bonus, here's a video showing where I got my inspiration.
