## Markdown for Week 5

I'll admit, this week was pretty tough.  I got into animation in p5 this week, and boy it wasn't easy.  Positioning the objects in my sketch was one thing, telling them where and how to move though, was a challenge.

For this week, I learned about; variables, loops, frameRates, simple math, mouse tracking, and readable code.  In fact, to be honest, the math and variables were my favorite parts of this week's lesson.  They actually help save a lot of time when creating objects in a digital sketch.  For my project, I was originally going to create a rotating, smiling cartoon sun.  But with time running out, and some of my complications getting in the way, I decided to change my sketch to a spinning Solar System.

My homework strategy for this week was the same as last week's.  I read over all of the website content for week 5, so that I briefly understood what I was learning first.  Then I wrote my code, and then worried about their positions after I got it all laid out.  I read through the examples on the homework page, Michael Musick's drawing example, and the p5 reference guide as I worked, just to make sure I was going on the right path with my sketch.  I even did some experimenting with the animation techniques I learned along the way.  Whenever I got stuck or frustrated, I temporarily left the assignment, then came back later to resolve the problems.

I had a hard time trying to create a rotating object, so I posted the issue on the main site.  Then, shortly after, a fellow student gave me a code from the example drawing that helped me greatly.  (I was against this idea at first because I was afraid of copying.)  Then Michael Musick told me that I had to specify the fill color BEFORE trying to draw the ellipse.  After that, I transitioned through the assignment very smoothly.  Also, my GitHub Desktop issue has been solved, so turning in my assignment was more easy peasy this time.

I spent a lot of time on this assignment, so I didn't have time to help out any of my fellow students with their issues for this week.  I'll try to squeeze in some time to help out next week.

I'm still enjoying this class overall, it's just getting harder.  And despite the difficulties I have faced, I feel that I have taken the next step forward into digital art.  And I hope to get more use to it all in the future.
