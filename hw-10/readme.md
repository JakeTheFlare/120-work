## Markdown for Week 10

This was one bugger of a week.  Last week, I dove into arrays.  This week, I got a little more into functions.  They both seemed pretty simple at first, but then came all the complicated stuff.  I tried way too hard to create something like that smiley function on the website, but I couldn't, and created something a little sloppy.

I tried everything for this week.  I read over all of the website content multiple times.  I watched the videos and looked at the drawing examples.  I downloaded the example drawings and experimented with their codes.  But I still had a hard time trying to understand what Musick did to create his smiley function and sketch. I eventually began losing interest in the assignment, so I had to stick with and turn in with what I got.  Finished is better than perfect after all.

I tried sharing some of my issues on the homework wiki, though not even my fellow students had the right/ perfect answers that could help me.  I have not helped with any issues for this week.

In conclusion, this was not a perfect week.  If only I took a little more time to read over and understand the math functions.  At least I got a little bit of an understanding of arrays and functions and how they work.  The end of the semester is coming soon, so I'll give it my best shot from here on out.
