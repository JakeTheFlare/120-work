## Markdown for Week 6

Another tough week.  For this week, I got into some of the Mathematics of Javascript.  I learned about topics like; the map function, random number generators, and math operators and functions, and constraining values.  The topics for this week's lesson were pretty confusing to me, I had to read all of the examples, videos, and content over and over and over again in order to try and understand it all, and it was kind of pain.  And to make it harder, one of the other hard parts was thinking about an idea for a sketch.  Even though I was beginning to understand the content at first, the sketch that I created was somewhat effortless and vague.  But as the class syllabus states...  "Finished is better than perfect. An attempt at them is better than nothing at all."  So I'm sticking with what I got and hope that I'll get some partial credit for it.

My homework strategy for this week was the same as always.  I read carefully read over all of the website content for week 6.  (As mentioned, I had to read them all over dozens of times in order to try and get a complete understanding.)  I read through the examples on the homework page, Michael Musick's drawing example, and the p5 reference guide, and even other student's examples, as I wrote my code.  I even tried experimenting with these techniques, though needless to say, hardly any of my intentions went according to plan.

I wanted to post some of my issues on the course site, but I felt embarrassed about how I was going to ask.  I didn't want to feel like a total moron and make it sound like I didn't understand the lesson at all, or go overboard with the number of issues I had.  I was even starting to lose my interest and enthusiasm for this project the longer I worked on it.

I spent a lot of time on this assignment, so I didn't have time to help out any of my fellow students with their issues for this week.

This week was hard for me, and it pains me to say it, but I'm not very proud of myself.  I don't have anything else to say, because I don't feel like sharing anymore.
