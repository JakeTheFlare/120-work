# HW 7 | Describe then Alter the Bouncing Ball

## Description of What the Original Code is Doing

Line 1 displays the name of the variable that I am working with, and lines 2-8 tells me the characteristics of the variable; the dimensions and position of the variable.

Lines 10-13 display the setup function and the canvas settings.  Line 17 displays the drawing function.  Lines 19 & 20 make the ball move across the screen, while lines 23-28 keep the ball inside the canvas.  Lines 30-32 is the drawing of the ball (or ellipse).

Line 34 displays the drawing function.  And finally, lines 35-37 are the mousePressed function that controls how fast the ball is moving across the screen, each time the mouse is clicked.


## How did you alter the sketch?
- I expanded the canvas to windowWidth and windowHeight, just because it seems more interesting to view the what's happening on the whole screen.
- I changed the background to a silver color and then gave the ball a gold color.  That way, it will help create a bit of a metallic feel for my piece.
- I increased the size of the ball and sped it up, in order to make it more fun to follow.
- I even altered the spacing of the ball as it moves along the canvas.  That way it can draw out a combination of textures while it moves.
