## Markdown for Week 8

[Link to my sketch.](https://jaketheflare.github.io/120-work/hw-8/)

It was nice to get an easy week for a change.  For this week, I learned all about <i>for</i> and <i>while</i> loops and <i>let</i> variables, and they're pretty efficient tools when trying to draw more than one object in JavaScript.

My step-by-step plan for this week was pretty straightforward.  I read over all of the lesson content, examples, and videos first thing before I got to work.  Then I began to layout my code.  And when I got stuck on something, I read over the all content a few more times, and the p5 reference guide as I worked.  I had some difficulty understanding the functions at first, but after experimenting with them on both the homework site and my sketch, I eventually got a better understanding on how they work.

Sadly, there were no new issues for me to help out with this week.  Guess the students in this class are starting to understand what they're learning.

I would like to get more into loops in the future.  I may find this as a tool I can use for my final project.
